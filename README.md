# migrate-deluge
A script to update deluge download locations from platform to platform with minimal file rechecks required. 

Can also assist with situations where your OS causes issues with drive names/lettering, or if you want to manually rename folders or switch mount points and not wait for, nor rely on Deluge to do it for you (right click -> move storage)
## Usage
In the target's deluge config directory run the following:

./migrate.sh 'Source's download path' 'Target's download path'

Where the source download path is like 'C:\Downloads\' and Target's is like '/mnt/downloads/'

## Instructions
(these are written for my specific use case of Windows to Linux.)

Pause all torrents in Deluge on Windows. Use the File->Quit option to close Deluge, and verify the system tray icon is gone and the program is closed.

Copy your entire existing deluge config from C:\Users\USERNAME\AppData\Roaming\deluge to ~/.config/deluge

Run the migrate script in your deluge config directory (~/.config/deluge) with the following arguments:

./migrate.sh 'Windows download path' 'Linux download path'

e.g. ./migrate.sh 'C:\downloads\' '/mnt/fileserver/downloads/'

You'll need to repeat this command for every download folder you use on Windows. 
Open deluge and confirm that all torrents show 100% and are still paused. Resume torrents and enjoy a migrated install without days of re-checking.

## Background

Windows stores all the relevant Deluge configuration and states by default in C:\Users\USERNAME\AppData\Roaming\deluge 

What is most relevant to a system transfer with many torrents is to migrate the state directory as it contains all torrents and statistics for the torrents, as well as the directory they are stored in and the percentage complete/available. 

If you don't copy this data over, Deluge will be in a strange configuration and will probably discard all the states and statistics for torrents, and will force a re-check on the entire library. This can take days for terabytes of content, so ideally a script to update all references would be helpful.
